# GameStudies-SteamPredictions
Repository for my project report for Computational Game Studies in SoSe 2023

## Goal
How do game review texts on Steam differ in terms of their thematic properties? To answer this question I scraped a corpus of about 100 million game reviews along with user generated tags for the respective game. Using machine learning algorithms like Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest I want to check if my models can predict the associated tags of reviews.
