## Goal
How do game review texts on Steam differ in terms of their linguistic properties? To answer this question I scraped a corpus of about 100 million game reviews along with user generated tags for the respective game. Using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) I want to check if my model can predict the associated tags of a review or a set of reviews.
